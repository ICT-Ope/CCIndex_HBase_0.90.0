CCIndex merged with HBase 0.90.0

CCIndex is short for Complemental Clustering Index which used to support Multi-Dimensional Range Query on Non-primary key attributes in HBase.

Codes of CCIndex  are in the following two packages :
	org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.ccindex
	org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.ccindex
There is a test case of CCIndex :
	org.apache.hadoop.hbase.CCIndexTestCase.java
The class named "MultiDimensionRangeQueryTest" is used to perform Multi-Dimensional Range Query.
Users can use "sequentialWrite" to create a CCIndex with three indexes and use "clusterScan" to perform Queries.
Further information please refer to the documents in doc file.
Current status:
 Add a log system to ensure the data consistency.
 Reconstruct CCIndex based on the coprocessor framework.
